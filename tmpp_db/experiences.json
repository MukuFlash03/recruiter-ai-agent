Engineered six GUI-based workflow runs for ETL pipelines with numerous tasks and integrated them with backend scripts to process data from pre-staging to end-user report generation stage. Enhanced UI for Individual Assessment (IA) module based on XML Forms Framework by customizing four UI Forms and eight PL/SQL scripts to process over 300,000 customer records by proposing to debug existing legacy code. Generated PL/SQL scripts for data manipulation and validation to automate manual tasks for filtering source data, reducing execution times by 20% while generating end-user reports containing customer data for over six months. Documented technical designs and deployed code packages across environments via WinSCP/PuTTY client-server apps.",
