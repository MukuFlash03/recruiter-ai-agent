A: In my next role, I'm primarily looking for opportunities for growth, learning, and making a significant impact. I'm seeking a position where I can contribute to building and scaling products that serve a large user base, ideally reaching over a million users. This kind of challenge excites me as it presents complex technical problems and the opportunity to learn about system scalability.
I'm also looking for an environment that encourages proactivity and ownership. My experience in hackathons and personal projects has shown me that I thrive when given the autonomy to tackle problems creatively. I'm eager to join a team where I can take initiative, propose solutions, and see them through to implementation.
Additionally, I value a collaborative team environment where I can learn from experienced colleagues while also contributing my own ideas. I'm particularly interested in roles that involve working with cutting-edge technologies and require continuous learning.
Lastly, I'm looking for a role that aligns with my personal values of creating technology that has a positive impact on users' lives.

A: I'm currently developing a Voice AI Interviewer Agent, which combines cutting-edge AI technologies with full-stack development to create an innovative interviewing tool.

After participating in the Build Club Supabase Superheroes hackathon, I decided to continue refining and expanding the Voice AI Interviewer Agent project.
I'm using TypeScript and NextJS for the frontend to ensure a robust and scalable application.
Leveraging Groq for fast inference to allow real-time processing of responses.
Implementing voice interaction using Vapi, which requires deep diving into voice processing technologies.
Integrating Supabase for secure user data management and authentication.
Developing an evaluation system with custom metrics to assess interview responses.

The project is ongoing, but it's already a fully functional AI-powered voice interviewer capable of conducting interviews, processing responses in real-time, and providing evaluations based on custom metrics. This project not only enhances my technical skills but also explores the intersection of AI and human interaction.

-----------------

A: The most challenging aspect of the Voice AI Interviewer Agent project is developing an accurate and nuanced evaluation system for interview responses.

While implementing the voice interaction and AI response generation was complex, creating an evaluation system that can accurately assess the quality and relevance of interview responses presents a unique challenge.

Researching best practices in interview assessment and AI-based evaluation systems.
Developing custom metrics that consider factors like relevance, clarity, and depth of responses.
Implementing machine learning algorithms to improve the evaluation accuracy over time.
Continuously testing and refining the system with diverse interview scenarios.
Collaborating with HR professionals to ensure the evaluations align with industry standards.

While still a work in progress, this challenge is pushing me to deepen my understanding of both AI technologies and human communication patterns. It's a perfect example of how I thrive on complex problems that require both technical skills and domain knowledge.
